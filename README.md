# Summer Olympics Analysis

The Olympics is an international sporting event.Participation in the event has expanded from 241 athletes to 11,500 since the last Olympics. Given the historical data throughout the Olympics, the odds of winning a medal (gold, silver, or bronze) could perhaps be given based on a few biological attributes of the athletes. So here we are going to do exploratory data analysis so we may visualize patterns within the dataset.
